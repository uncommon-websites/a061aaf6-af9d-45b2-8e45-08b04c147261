    "prompt": "A professional growth marketer in a modest, modern office space, subtly celebrating a recent achievement. The scene is captured in a documentary editorial style, with natural golden hour lighting casting a warm, optimistic glow (echoing Growth Gold tones). The marketer stands near a desk scattered with real notebooks, coffee cups, and analog materials, displaying calm, confident satisfaction. The composition uses generous negative space and layered depth, with the subject positioned off-center, surrounded by natural materials like wood and glass. The environment feels authentic and approachable, with subtle pops of navy and gold in clothing or decor. No screens, dashboards, or text are visibleâ€”only genuine, lived-in details that convey strategic success and focused momentum.",
